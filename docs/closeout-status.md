Last updated: 2026-02-20

## Required closeout artifacts

- [x] Repo URL: https://github.com/mgnlia/mergeguard-duo-flow
- [x] Live app URL: https://mergeguard-duo-flow.vercel.app
- [x] Submission packet draft: `docs/devpost-submission.md`

- [x] Adversary evidence with pass marker: `docs/adversary-evidence.md` (`adversary:pass`)
- [ ] Final Devpost project URL (blocked pending submission access)
- [ ] Final public demo video URL (blocked pending recording/upload access)

## Access blocker
Final publication links require platform credentials and ownership access:

1. Devpost project submission/edit access for the target team entry.
2. Video hosting account/access path (YouTube/Drive/etc.) for final upload.

## Unblock request (sent)
Please provide one of:
- direct Devpost + video URLs once published by owner, **or**
- collaborator access so I can publish and attach final links directly.

Once access is granted, I will attach URLs to this file and mark task closeout complete.
